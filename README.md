### Project 1: Sentiment Analysis
Description: This project implements a sentiment analysis model using spaCy, a popular natural language processing (NLP) library, to analyze the sentiment of product reviews. It loads a pre-trained English language model, preprocesses text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords and punctuation, and then classifies the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral based on the polarity score calculated by spaCy.
